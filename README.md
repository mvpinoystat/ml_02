# Machine Learning: Kaggle's Linking Writing Process To Writing Quality  

This contains the notebooks and python script iterations used prior to submitting the final notebook to the competition on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/linking-writing-processes-to-writing-quality . This is a regression problem with Root Mean Squared error being the evaluation metric. Since this is a code competition, the notebook kernel is executed using Kaggle's website.  

The models used here are a BaggingRegressor with XGBoostRegressor as the base model. A Keras / Tensorflow Regression model is also implemented. See the file modeling.py and various notebooks specific to each submission.
